        <li> French Fry Style
           <p>A classic! Don't fix something that is not broken, right? Easiest shape fit into the small ketchup cups too. Also very managable to eat while on the road. 
            A standard beside every burger, great with wings too.
            Can be dipped in various sauces.

        </li>
       
        <li> Waffle Fries
           <p> My personal favorite. Has much more of a warm-soft center, surface area wise that everyone loves! 
            Can hold many more toppings making it more of an appetizer than a side. This option retains heat much better, don't ask me about the science behind that though.
           </p>
         </li> 

        <li> Tator-Tots
           <p>The cruchiest of them all. Can be hot to the touch so be careful! I would highly recommend using this as the base for a yummy
            breakfast bowl. This option has to be the most fun to play with, although you really should not be playing with your food!
