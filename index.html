            <li> <h2>French Fry</h2>
              <p>A classic! Don't fix something that is not broken, right? Easiest shape fit into the small ketchup cups too. Also very managable to eat while on the road. 
                A standard beside every burger, great with wings too.
               Can be dipped in various sauces. Very delicious! Added words for more visual impact. Added words for more visual impact. Added words for more visual impact.

            <li> <h2>Waffle Fries</h2>
               <p> My personal favorite. Has much more of a warm-soft center, surface area wise that everyone loves! 
               Can hold many more toppings making it more of an appetizer than a side. This option retains heat much better, don't ask me about the science behind that though.
               The best potato to use for this one is going to be the sweet potato!  Added words for more visual impact. Added words for more visual impact. Added words for more visual impact.

            <li> <h2>Tator-Tots</h2>
              <p>The cruchiest of them all. Can be hot to the touch so be careful! I would highly recommend using this as the base for a yummy
              breakfast bowl. This option has to be the most fun to play with, although you really should not be playing with your food! Added words for more visual impact.
